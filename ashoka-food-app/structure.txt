Categories need to be cuisines and not restaurants

Search Bar input should give all restaurants that have the input item in their menu. 
    -   For example, if user searches "paratha", Roti Boti and Dhaba Restaurant Cards should pop up.

Delivery Location will be a dropdown with only 5 options: 
    -   RH1, RH2, RH3, RH4, RH5 (w small images of each rh next to each, we can try design out)

Landing Page requires google login
    -   Only ashoka email id allowed so we will have to create google credentials using an ashoka email id 
    -   Need to figure if to create them from one of our email IDs or approach ashoka admin to make us an email ID for it,
        which can later be used for techsupport also - "write to us at {foodappname}@ashoka.edu.in 
        if a problem, feedback or anything at all"
